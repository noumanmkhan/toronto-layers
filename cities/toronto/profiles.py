"""Neighbourhood lenses from the City's 2021 Neighbourhood Profiles (2021 Census, 158 neighbourhoods).
Input: raw/neighbourhood_profiles_2021.xlsx (fetched by fetch_profiles.py)
Output: docs/toronto/data/nbhd_profiles.json  {neighbourhood number: {...figures and tiers...}}

Three lenses, each a simple, labelled tier rather than a precise figure. The point is the feel
of a neighbourhood relative to the rest of Toronto, not a price list.

Housing cost: what households there pay, combining owners and renters. Each neighbourhood's median
  home value and median rent are ranked against all 158; the two ranks are averaged, weighted by
  its share of owners and renters, then split into thirds (lower / middle / higher).
Getting to work: share of commuters who drive (car, truck or van, as driver or passenger).
  Mostly car 68%+, mixed 50-68%, mostly transit / walk / bike under 50%.
Renters and owners: share of households that rent. Mostly owners under 35%, a mix 35-60%,
  mostly renters over 60%.

To Union by transit: if raw/transit_union.json is present (computed by fetch_transit_union.py in
  GitHub Actions), each neighbourhood also gets its typical weekday-morning transit time to Union
  Station, banded under 30, 30-45, 45-60 and over 60 minutes.

Card-only descriptions (no tiers, never ranked):
- Homes by type (occupied private dwellings by structural type): detached; semi and row (semi-detached,
  row, other single-attached); low-rise apartments (duplex flats and buildings under five storeys);
  towers (five or more storeys). Shares of all occupied dwellings, so movable dwellings make up any gap.
  The housing-type lens shades neighbourhoods by one type's share.
- When it was built (occupied dwellings by period of construction): 1960 or before, 1961-1980,
  1981-2000, 2001-2021.
- Language spoken most often at home (single responses), as shares of everyone in private households.
  Up to five languages are kept; the page shows three. People naming two or more languages equally
  (multiple responses) aren't split between them; their share is kept as langMulti for a note.
- Ages (everyone): under 15, 15-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65 and over, as shares of the population.
- Recent immigrants: people who immigrated to Canada from 2016 to 2021, as a share of everyone in
  private households (the Census immigration table's total). Card only: never a lens, filter or fact.

Caveats shown on the page: Census figures are from 2021; commuting was counted in May 2021,
during the pandemic, when transit use was unusually low everywhere."""
