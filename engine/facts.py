"""Facts engine: what makes each neighbourhood / community area stand out, for the "What's here" card.
Usage: python3 engine/facts.py <city>   (run after the city's profiles file is built)

Each unit is ranked against its peers on figures the map already has, and its strongest standing
becomes a short sentence ("Highest rents in North York", "Quickest trip to the Loop on the South
Side"). Peers are the whole city and the unit's own areas: "facts.peers" in city.json lists one or
more fill layers (Toronto: Old Toronto's Downtown/Midtown/… and the former cities; Chicago: the
sides). Areas with fewer than MIN_PEERS units aren't used as a peer group.

Rules (see app-contract/DATA_CONTRACT.md, "Describe, don't rank"):
- Only non-demographic figures: housing cost, tenure, getting to work, home types, age of homes,
  transit time downtown, tree canopy (high end only). Language and anything like it never feed facts.
- Money facts are worded softly at the low end ("Among the most affordable rents"), never
  "cheapest" or "lowest value".
- A fact needs a top-3 (or bottom-3) place. Strength is place / group size, so third of 158 beats
  first of 22; ties in a figure share a place, and a place shared by more than 3 units doesn't count.
- "Longest transit trip downtown" is kept but ranked last when choosing which fact leads.
- It must also stand out: at least 20% away from the group's median (and, for shares, at least
  5 points), so "top 3 for biking at 4%" doesn't count.

Writes "facts" into docs/<city>/data/<lens.file>: up to 3 per unit, strongest first:
  [{"text", "field", "end": "high"|"low", "scope": "city"|"peers", "rank", "of", "value"}]
